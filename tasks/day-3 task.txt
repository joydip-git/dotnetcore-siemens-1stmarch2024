Business Layer: seats between Data access layer and UI (Main method, Program class)
UI will NOT interact with ProductDao, but with business layer class
business layer class will interact with ProductDao class

create a business layer with following methods:
	method to return all products by default sorted by product id
	method to return all products sorted by user choice
	method to return single product
	method to add a single product (product id should be generate by logic and also should check whether UI has sent a null reference instead of product object)
	method to update a single product (product id should be sent separately along with product object with updated values and also should check whether UI has sent a null reference instead of product object)
	method to delete a single product by given id
	method to filter the list of products by name of the product

we need dependency injection of business layer in UI
also business layer class will depend on ProductDao class
